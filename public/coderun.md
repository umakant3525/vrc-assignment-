## API Testing with Postman

To test the API endpoints, import the provided collection into your Postman workspace.

- **Postman Collection**: [Test API Collection Documentation Link](https://cloudy-station-320017.postman.co/workspace/My-Workspace~01d79ffe-e586-424b-8319-b20aa12fa944/collection/29744482-1ddb11ce-8b29-4b2e-80e2-b69ac742d3ab?action=share&creator=29744482)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or while testing APIs, ensure:

- Redis is running before starting the server.
- MongoDB is properly set up and the required collections exist.
- Environment variables in the `.env` file are correctly configured.
